My name is Minh-Hoang Bui, a machine learning engineer.

I graduated from Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering of Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, one of the most prestigious engineering school in Vietnam. During my bachelor, I equip myself with the knowledge of signal processing and embedded system. I also pursued two international internship: one as a technical intern with SCG Group in Bangkok, one as research intern in image processing with Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology.

After graduating with high distinction, I earned an [Excellence Scholarship](https://vn.ambafrance.org/Programme-de-Bourses-d-Excellence-de-l-Ambassade-de-France-au-Vietnam-appel-a-4627) from French Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Master Degree. During my time in France, I acquired knowledge about statistics and optimization, which is extremely useful for a data scientist.

I have been working as MLE/SWE for the last 7 years and I love this job. In my freetime, I'd like to read tech blog in Medium and other sources. I'm also a Leetcoder, it's my way to keep my mind sharp and to be active in labour market.

For the last 2 years, I've lived in Canada and work as a machine learning for a startup in Montreal


I work mainly in Python and my favorite frameworks in Deep Learning are TensorFlow and PyTorch.
As a machine learning engineer, I am motivated and willing to contribute my knowledge and skills to any company which appreciate them. I am open to any opportunity in the domain of Data Science which involves researching and implementing deep learning architectures.
