My name is Minh-Hoang Bui, a junior data scientist.

I graduated from Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, one of the 
most prestigious engineering school in Vietnam. During my bachelor, I studied about signal processing, embedded 
programming and theory of automation. I also pursued two international internship: one as a technical intern with SCG 
Group in Bangkok, one as research intern in image processing with Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology.

After graduating with high distinction, I earned an [Excellence Scholarship](https://vn.ambafrance.org/Programme-de-Bourses-d-Excellence-de-l-Ambassade-de-France-au-Vietnam-appel-a-4627) from French Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Master Degree. During my time in France, I acquired knowledge about statistics and optimization, which is extremely useful for a data scientist. For the internship program, I am chosen as an Master intern by [LETI](http://www.leti-cea.com/cea-tech/leti/english/Pages/Welcome.aspx) of CEA. CEA is the most prestigious research organization in France. Many key inventions in nuclear weapons, nano-technologies are created from this institution.

Following this, I returned to Vietnam and works as a junior data scientist in an e-commerce startup named Chappiebot Inc. 
My role here is to develop and implement state-of-the-art algorithm to classify image in their website and also 
preprocess user command using NLP.

At the moment, I'm working in a Japanese company which focuses on the applications of Deep Learning, especially Computer 
Vision, in retail industry. My main mission is to optimize deep learning model to work well within embedded system.

I work mainly in Python and my favorite frameworks in Deep Learning are TensorFlow and PyTorch.
As a junior data scientist, I am motivated and willing to contribute my knowledge and skills to any companies which 
treasure them. I am open to any offer in the domain of Data Science which involves researching and implementing deep 
learning architectures.
