My name is Minh-Hoang Bui, a junior data scientist.
About my background, I graduated from Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, one of the most prestigious. During my bachelor, I studied about signal processing, embedded programming and theory of automation. I also pursued two international internship: one as a technical intern with SCG Group in Bangkok, one as research intern in image processing with Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology.
After graduating with high distinction, I earned an [Excellence Scholarship](https://vn.ambafrance.org/Programme-de-Bourses-d-Excellence-de-l-Ambassade-de-France-au-Vietnam-appel-a-4627) from French Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Master Degree. During my time in France, I acquired knowledge about statistics and optimization, which is extremely useful for a data scientist. For the internship program, I am chosen as an Master intern by [LETI](http://www.leti-cea.com/cea-tech/leti/english/Pages/Welcome.aspx) of CEA. CEA is the most prestigious research organization in France. Many key inventions in nuclear weapons, nano-technologies are created from this institution.
Following this, I returned to Vietnam and works as a junior data scientist in an e-commerce startup named Chappiebot Inc. My role here is to develop and implement state-of-the-art algorithm to classify image in their website and also preprocess user command using NLP.
I work mainly in Python and my favorite frameworks in Deep Learning are TensorFlow and PyTorch.
As a junior data scientist, I am motivated and willing to contribute my knowledge and skills to any company which treasure them. I am open to any offer in the domain of Data Science which involves researching and implementing deep learning architecture.
