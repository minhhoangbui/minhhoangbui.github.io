## From 12/2022 to 11/2023: Machine Learning Engineer at Noze

My first job in Canada is to build machine platform to automate training and deployment. The system is highly resilient and scalable, which is crucial since we want to play a key player in medical industry. I also play a leading role in leveraging unlabelled data to improve our current ML system.


## From 01/2021 to 10/2022: Machine Learning Engineer at Zalo

My third job is with Zalo, which operates the most popular social platform in Vietnam. I was in charge of User Verification service which is to prevent fraud and criminal activities on the platform. I was working on redesign and optimize the system pipeline to improve its accuracy and throughput/latency. Moreover, I helped to leverage speech data from Zalo to build TTS model and provide API as a product for users who like this feature.

## From 03/2019 to 01/2021: Machine Learning Engineer at AWL Vietnam

My second job was with AWL Vietnam. This company were building self-checkout system for retail industry in Japan. In order to realize that ambition, we focused on developing Computer Vision models for person re-identification and object detection tasks. These models will be deployed on edge devices in favour of cost, hence, I had to hone my skills in embedded programming and model optimization as well.

Also during this time, I contributed to first version of data platform, which we decided to build for data analysis.

## From 10/2017 to 02/2019: Machine Learning Engineer at Chappiebot

After graduating from Master course, I returned to Vietnam and joined this startup ever since.

Chappiebot provided a platform for automobile where users can come and ask questions about their favorite cars. Along with 2 other engineers, we were in charge of the whole pipeline, from data collection, model training to deployment/monitoring.

In order to fulfill that mission, we need a pool of vision models like: image classification, segmentation and object detection. Furthermore, NLP models like text classification, entity tagging were also leveraged to understand users's querries better. Our machine learning pipeline was entirely on AWS.

## 01/2017 - 09/2017: Research Intern at CEA-LETI

After the theoretical semester at engineering school in France, I started to search for some places for hosting me as an intern, maybe in a lab or a company. Then, I was chosen by CEA-LETI, which is  synonymous for developing breakthrough inventions in nanotechnology and microelectronics.

During this time at CEA-LETI, I was assigned to develop and implement an edge detection technique named _Active Contour_ to a special SEM images which is popular in micro-electronics. Furthermore, another intern worked with Neural Network with the same purpose, and we will compare two approaches with each other.

## 06/2016 - 08/2016: Internship at Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology

I applied for this internship at the last semester in Vietnam to know more about research activities in foreign countries. Only two students was selected for this fully covered program and this was my second international internship in Thailand.

I worked for professor Suchada Rianmore with the topic of image processing and 3D reconstruction. During this time, I started to step into image world with the help of OpenCV in C++ to deal with some simple task like edge detection, image filtering etc.
