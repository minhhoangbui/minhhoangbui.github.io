## Since 10/2017: Data Scientist in Chappiebot Inc.

After graduating from Master course, I returned to Vietnam and joined this startup ever since.

In the beginning, I was assigned to cover the computer vision part of _OtoNhanh.vn_. We constructs this site as a connection between dealer system and end user in automobile industry. People can access the gallery collection of almost every car in the market and also can book a test drive online. Every image in this site is arranged with the help of machine learning techniques like image classification and image similarity.

Then, we construct a news distribution platform for 24h Inc., a large multimedia corporation in Vietnam. To boost the profit for the company, they decide to build a personalized news distribution for each user. We investigate the action of each user, predict their preferences then give them what they want. This project requires various techniques in NLP like NER Tagger, Topic classification, etc. Beside that, we have to build a solid platform for storing data and distributing smoothly the articles to millions of users.

During this time, I acquire several skills in deployment with Deep Learning, how to transform a scientific article to a machine learning model then make it usable by the outsider in a scalable way. Furthermore, in the startup, I'm given the opportunity to study more about other applications of machine learning which I have not got a chance to know like image similarity of Name-entity recognition etc. It is rough but it helps to broaden my mind in this particular domain.

## 01/2017 - 09/2017: Research Intern in CEA-LETI

After the theoretical semester at engineering school in France, I started to search for some places for hosting me as an intern, maybe in a lab or a company. Then, I was chosen by CEA-LETI, it is just like a dream comes true. CEA is a huge research establishment in France. It covers many kinds of researches. From weapons development to nano-technologies, LETI is a sub-organization of CEA which is responsible for developing breakthrough inventions in nanotechnology and microelectronics. It is truly a research center but it has a deep connection with industries, for example, STM etc.

During this time at CEA-LETI, I was assigned to develop and implement an edge detection technique named _Active Contour_ to a special SEM images which is popular in micro-electronics. Furthermore, another intern worked with Neural Network with the same purpose, and we will compare two approaches with each other.

To fulfil this task, I had to equip myself the knowledge of optimization and image processing. Moreover, I acquired the ability to work with other people coming from different culture. In my team, everyone is french except me and our communication was conducted totally in french.

## 06/2016 - 08/2016: Internship at Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology

I applied for this internship at the last semester in Vietnam to know more about research activities in foreign countries. Only two students was selected for this fully covered program and this was my second internship in Thailand.

I worked for professor Suchada Rianmore with the topic of image processing and 3D reconstruction. During this time, I started to step into image world with the help of OpenCV in C++ to deal with some simple task like edge detection, image filtering etc. I also had a chance to work with some machines that we use
to construct 3D design of an object. It was really a milestone for me when I decided to glue myself with computer vision and image processing.
